# Flight Price Prediction: Machine Learning Project using Render

Traveling is something I really enjoy, but one thing that always gets to me is the unpredictable cost of flights. One day the price is low, and the next day it jumps up, making it hard to know when to book. This got me thinking—what if I could predict those price changes and help people, including myself, save money?

That’s what led me to start this "Flight Price Prediction" project. Using machine learning, I’ve built a model that looks at different factors like booking time, season, and airline to predict flight prices. The idea is simple: give people a better sense of when to book their flights to get the best deal.

Working on this project has been a fun way to combine my love for travel with my interest in technology. It’s practical, easy to understand, and, most importantly, can make a real difference in how we plan our trips. I hope this project helps you feel more confident about booking your next flight, without worrying about price surprises.
