# Flight Price Prediction: Machine Learning Project using Streamlit

[Model Web Application](https://flight-price-prediction-cirod8zbvhtv4ncecdwnct.streamlit.app/)

Using machine learning, I’ve built a model that looks at different factors like booking time, season, and airline to predict flight prices. The idea is simple: give people a better sense of when to book their flights to get the best deal.

Working on this project has been a fun way to combine my love for travel with my interest in technology. It’s practical, easy to understand, and, most importantly, can make a real difference in how we plan our trips. I hope this project helps you feel more confident about booking your next flight, without worrying about price surprises.

In this i have used multiple features from Kaggle Flight data to predict the flight prices considering the features.
